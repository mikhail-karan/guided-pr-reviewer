[-] Allow users to leave inline comments on the diff.
[ ] Make it so that the Potentials Risks section in guidance shows you which lines are at risk. It should allow you to hover over the risk and see the lines highlighted.
[ ] The current in line AI Explanations encompass to much, I want them to be a bit more granular so that they can be shown more in line with the code especially if there are multiple changes in a single hunk.
[ ] the diff view should show the complexity and impact so I don't have to go back and forth between the diff and session
[ ] all buttons should have cursor pointer and have proper accessibility attributes
[ ] make the UI not part of the docker container but connect to the docker container 
[ ] add a loader to submit review button
[ ] make it easier to get to submit review final stage
[ ] steps don't really make sense in the current context as I first meant for steps to be treated as potential groups of changes that are related to each other. which isn't the case right now. Lets see if we can make it so that steps are more like a group of changes that are related to each other.
[ ] The design could use some work, it could be more modern and sleek. Add a dark mode. 
[ ] When adding a comment in the notes and comments section it doesn't seem to reference the file that it adds comments to when submitting the comment.
[ ] We can remove the 'notes' section as it's not really needed and can be replaced with comments.
[ ] After logging in with github you should be able to create a github app for whatever repository you need without having to put in the .env github app details (like it is required right now) unless this is impossible to do with the github api.
[ ] When I start review and the AI is generating the steps and guidance I have to manually refresh the page to see the changes. We need to find a way to get the changes to update in real time.
[ ] Add a link to the PR in the session overview.
